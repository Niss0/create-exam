# create-exam program
# this is my final project in OOP in java.
This project is all about creating an exam from a built-in questions pool with the ability to add quesiton and answers to the data pool aswell.

#In order for the project to work, you must first download the entire folder (the program uses a binary file in order to store the exam data).
all changes made to the data pool will be saved in the binary file.

#feel free to play with the program!
